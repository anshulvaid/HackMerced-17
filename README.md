# HackMerced-17
Project built for the Hackathon held at UCM
It is an e-commerce Android application called Shop3D. It is based on Augmented Reality and aims at bringing the products to ones home before they are actually bought. The application currently is in its nascent stages, where-in there are only limited products (majorly furniture as of now), and not all functionalities of e-commerce are present in the application, yet.
